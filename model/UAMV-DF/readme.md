# UAMV-DF

##### generate_5_cross_validation.py is used to generate training and test sets for ten-fold cross-validation.
##### main.py is a demo of the running code, and the get_config method allows you to set hyperparameters. Be careful not to set uncertainty_threshold too large, or the program will report something wrong. The recommended value is between 0.04 and 0.25,but the setting varies depending on the data.
##### The result of running the program can be found in the output, test_opinion and train_opinion folders. Includes performance reports on the training set and test set.
##### The python environment needed to run the code can be found in requirements.txt.
